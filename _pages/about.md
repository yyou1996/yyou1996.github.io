I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University supervised by Prof. [Yang Shen](https://shen-lab.github.io), and unofficially co-supervised by Prof. [Zhangyang Wang](https://www.atlaswang.com), and I received my bachelor's degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University. More details are available at [CV](https://yyou1996.github.io/files/yuning_cv.pdf).

My research interests include but are not limited to graph machine learning and self-supervised learning. A repo on graph self-supervision literature can be found [here](https://github.com/ChandlerBang/awesome-self-supervised-gnn). Besides, our lab is recruiting [postdocs](https://shen-lab.github.io/positions-201712.pdf) and [excellent Ph.D. students](https://shen-lab.github.io/Positions-TAMU-ECE-Shen.pdf). \\
