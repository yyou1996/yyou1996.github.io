👨‍🎓**Bio.** I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, supervised by Prof. [Yang Shen](https://shen-lab.github.io) and unofficially co-supervised by Prof. [Zhangyang Wang](https://www.atlaswang.com). I received my bachelor's degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University. More details are available at [CV](https://yyou1996.github.io/files/yuning_cv.pdf).
Besides, our lab is recruiting excellent [postdocs](https://shen-lab.github.io/positions-201712.pdf) and [Ph.D. students](https://shen-lab.github.io/Positions-TAMU-ECE-Shen.pdf).

🕮**Interests.** My research interests mainly locate in graph self-supervised learning and its application on drug discovery.
E.g. (i) graph contrastive learning ([GraphCL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13902)) with its automated versions ([JOAO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07594) and [GraphCL-LP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01702)),
(ii) heuristic self-supervision on graphs ([SS-GCNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09136)),
and (iii) an [application](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.29.403162v1) in protein-ligand interaction prediction.
A repo on the literature of self-supervision on graphs can be found [here](https://github.com/ChandlerBang/awesome-self-supervised-gnn). \\
