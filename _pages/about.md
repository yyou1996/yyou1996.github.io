I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Shen Lab of Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University supervised by Prof. [Yang Shen](https://shen-lab.github.io/), and personally co-supervised by Prof. [Zhangyang Wang](https://www.atlaswang.com/), and I received my bachelor's degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University. More details are availabel at [CV](https://yyou1996.github.io/files/yuning_cv.pdf).

My research interests include but are not limited to graph machine learning and self-supervised learning. I am excited about any research that can provide interesting insights. \\
