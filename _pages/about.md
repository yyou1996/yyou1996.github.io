🧑‍🎓**Bio.** I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student (2019 -- expected 2024) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, advised by Prof. [Yang Shen](https://shen-lab.github.io) and unofficially co-advised by Prof. [Zhangyang Wang](https://vita-group.github.io/). I received my bachelor's degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University. More details are available at [CV](https://yyou1996.github.io/files/yuning_cv.pdf).

Besides, our lab is recruiting excellent [Ph.D. students](https://shen-lab.github.io/Positions-TAMU-ECE-Shen.pdf), [postdocs](https://shen-lab.github.io/positions-201712.pdf), and student workers if you are TAMU students.

📖**Research.** My research focuses on graph machine learning and computational biology.
E.g. (i) graph contrastive learning ([GraphCL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13902)) with its automated versions ([JOAO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07594), [GraphCL-LP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01702)),
<!-- (ii) heuristic self-supervision on graphs ([SS-GCNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09136)), -->
(ii) its extension on hypergraphs ([HyperGCL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03801)),
and (iii) its application to protein-ligand interaction prediction ([paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.18.500559v1)).
A repo on graph self-supervised learning literatures can be found [here](https://github.com/ChandlerBang/awesome-self-supervised-gnn). \\
