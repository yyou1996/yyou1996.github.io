<span style="color:blue">**Bio.**</span> I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering at <ins>Cal</ins>ifornia Institute of <ins>Tech</ins>nology, advised by Prof. [Matt Thomson](https://thomsonlab.caltech.edu).
Before that, I received the Ph.D. degree from <ins>T</ins>exas <ins>A</ins>&<ins>M</ins> <ins>U</ins>niversity, advised by Prof. [Yang Shen](https://shen-lab.github.io) and co-advised by Prof. [Zhangyang (Atlas) Wang](https://vita-group.github.io/), and the B.Eng. degree from <ins>X</ins>i'an <ins>J</ins>iao<ins>t</ins>ong <ins>U</ins>niversity. Please refer to my [CV](https://yyou1996.github.io/files/yuning_cv.pdf) for more information.

<!-- 🧫<span style="color:blue">**Research.**</span> -->

My research focuses on **machine learning** on non-Euclidean data (e.g. **graphs** or point clouds) and in **dynamical** systems, with fundamental understanding in theory and applications to real-world problems in **life sciences** (in particular modeling of molecular and cellular systems).
Please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Pv-V2igAAAAJ) for a complete list of the established works.

<span style="color:red">**Recruitment.**</span>
I am starting an AI for Life Sciences laboratory at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en), in the School of Science and Engineering, and recruiting PhD students and research assistants.
If you are passionate about leveraging AI techniques to build virtual biological systems (virtual cells, tissues, organs, etc.), please consider to [join us](https://yyou1996.github.io/laboratory/)!
