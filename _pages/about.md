<span style="color:red">**I am on the 2023-2024 job market.**</span>

üßë‚Äçüéì**Bio.** I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate (2019 -- expected 2024) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, advised by Prof. [Yang Shen](https://shen-lab.github.io) and co-advised by Prof. [Zhangyang Wang](https://vita-group.github.io/). I received my bachelor's degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University. For more details please refer to my [CV](https://yyou1996.github.io/files/yuning_cv.pdf).

Besides, our lab is recruiting excellent [Ph.D. students](https://shen-lab.github.io/Positions-TAMU-ECE-Shen.pdf), [postdocs](https://shen-lab.github.io/positions-201712.pdf), and student workers if you are TAMU students.

‚öóÔ∏è**Research.** I am interested in **machine learning** on **non-Euclidean** data (e.g. graphs or hypergraphs), with fundamental understanding in theory and challenging real-world applications to **biomedicine**.
Representative works include:
- Graph contrastive self-supervised learning ([GraphCL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13902), 1k+‚úçÔ∏è) with its automated versions (e.g. [JOAO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07594)) and extension on hypergraphs ([HyperGCL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03801));
- A model-based risk bound analysis of graph domain adaptation ([GDA](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OysfLgrk8mk));
- An application of graph self-supervised learning to compound-protein affinity and contact prediction ([CPAC](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.18.500559v1)).

Moreover, for a glance of research in the field of graph self-supervised learning, please refer to the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/ChandlerBang/awesome-self-supervised-gnn) (1k+‚≠ê).
