<span style="color:blue">**Bio.**</span> I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering at California Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. [Matt Thomson](https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/people/matt-thomson).
Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree from Texas A&M University, advised by Prof. [Yang Shen](https://shen-lab.github.io) and co-advised by Prof. [Zhangyang (Atlas) Wang](https://vita-group.github.io/), and B.Eng. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University. For more details please refer to my [CV](https://yyou1996.github.io/files/yuning_cv.pdf).

<!-- üß´<span style="color:blue">**Research.**</span> -->
My research focuses on **machine learning** on non-Euclidean data (e.g. **graphs** or hypergraphs), with fundamental understanding in theory and applications to real-world problems in **life science** (molecular/cellular systems).
Please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Pv-V2igAAAAJ) for a complete list of my works.

<!-- Representative works include: -->
<!-- - Graph contrastive self-supervised learning ([GraphCL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13902), 1k+‚úçÔ∏è) with its automated versions (e.g. [JOAO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07594)) and extension on hypergraphs ([HyperGCL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03801)); -->
<!-- - A model-based risk bound analysis of graph domain adaptation ([GDA](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OysfLgrk8mk)); -->
